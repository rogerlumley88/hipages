- First run of basic analyses shows smaller tasks less likely to be accepted than medium
- Similarly, category 5 tasks less likely, cat 3 most likely
- Unlike my initial assumption, DOW is not important
- TOD is basically a before-or-after midday split: after midday much more likely to be accepted
	- Could be turned into boolean (after midday t/f)

- Looking at long/lat data, see that there are 3 regions (potentially different cities in Aus or countries e.g. Aus, NZ, SEA)
- Using Region as a calculated field + then filter, see there is different change in behaviour between regions
	- Small difference in DOW
	- Bigger difference in category
- Split category by regions but little difference
- Not much difference with category by size either

- Looking at number of tradies, far less tradies in category 5 but similar number of impressions
	- Result in high impression/tradie but low acceptance rate


## Which parameters influence if a job would be accepted?

Based on the above, the key parameters would be:
	- Size of the job
	- Whether the job is after midday or not
	- Category / number of tradies
	- Region
	
To understand the impact each of these has on probability of acceptance, 
best approach would be logistic regression analysis (due to binary acceptance) with these parameters
